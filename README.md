This research proposes an IoT-based solution incorporating camera-based motion detection for accurate and real-time passenger occupancy tracking. The system leverages the power of the Internet of Things (IoT) to connect various hardware components, enabling seamless data collection and analysis.

The core of the system relies on camera sensors strategically placed inside public transport vehicles. These cameras capture real-time video feeds, which are then processed using a motion detection algorithm. The algorithm analyzes the video frames to identify passenger movement patterns, distinguishing between entries and exits, and providing a dynamic count of passengers within the vehicle.
